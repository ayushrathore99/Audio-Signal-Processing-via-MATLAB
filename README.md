# Audio-Signal-Processing-via-MATLAB
Developed an audio signal processing system in MATLAB implementing advanced DSP algorithms for spectral analysis, noise suppression, and real‑time filtering. Utilized FFT/STFT for time‑frequency analysis, performed feature extraction, and applied Audio enhancement techniques optimized for Embedded DSP Integration.
